          Who is Vulnerable to Trafficking?
        </h2>
        <p>

          While no demographic is immune to trafficking, victims of trafficking were found to share similar life
          experiences such as:

          child trafficking information

          57% had been sexually abused as children.
          49% had been physically assaulted.
          85% were victims of incest as girls, and 90% had been physically abused.
          61.5% were frequently hit, slapped, pushed, or had objects thrown at them by a member of their household.
          40% of the above were kicked, hit, beaten, raped, or threatened and/or attacked with a weapon by a member of
          their household.

        <h3>What are the signs?</h3>
        <p>
          Victims are not well cared for, so they are sometimes injured or appear malnourished. They may wear the same
          outfit every day and not have any legal forms of identification. Because theyâ€™ve been emotionally manipulated,
          they may seem afraid of strangers, reluctant to make eye contact or speak to others. They also may be scared
          of law enforcement or other authority figures.
